I come from China. Now I live in Masschusetts for 4 years (2019.2 --  2022). 
I am learning Java, MySQL, Computer Networking, Discrete Math, Linux.
My dream is to be a full stack programmer.
Data Structrue and Algorithms are complicated buy I keep learing.
I know the framework like SpringBoot are important , but the basic knowledge such as computer organization and design, conputer architecture and so on are essential (more important) in my mind.
The computer world is an extension of the real world, but it's also full of compromisesz. Nothing is perfect, but we can try our best to do something meaningful.
